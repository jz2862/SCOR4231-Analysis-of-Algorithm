# SCOR4231-Analysis-of-Algorithm
Columbia University

This course focuses on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. We will discuss general design paradigms as well as specific problems.

A preliminary list of topics follows.

- Fundamentals: induction, asymptotics, recurrences
- Sorting and searching: insertion sort, merge-sort, quicksort, binary search
- Graph algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search, shortest paths
- Greedy algorithms: huffman coding, minimum spanning trees
- Network flows
- Dynamic programming: data segmentation, sequence alignment
- Linear programming
- Reductions and NP-completeness
- Hashing: Bloom filters, document similarity
- Approximation algorithms
