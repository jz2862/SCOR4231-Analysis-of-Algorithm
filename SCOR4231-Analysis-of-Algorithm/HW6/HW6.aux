There's a given set A of ordered pairs $(i, j)$, where a pair $(i, j)$ indicates that person i can be matched with object j. For every pair $(i, j) \in A$, thereâ€™s a value $a_{ij}$ for matching person i with object j. Our goal is to assign persons to objects so as to maximize the total value of the assignment.}{5}}

For each facility $i \in F$ and each client $j \in D$, there is a cost $c_{ij}$ of assigning client j to facility i. Further, there is a one-time cost $f_i$ associated with opening and operating facility i. Find a subset $F'$ of facilities to open that minimizes the total cost of (i) operating the facilities in $F'$ and (ii) assigning every client j to one of the facilities in $F'$.}{5}}
